# The five thieves of time

1. Too much wip (too much yes, context switching, quality suffers, increases costs, irritated staff)
2. Unknown dependencies (architecture, expert, activity; coordination, availability and information, probability of failure)
3. Unplanned work (adds unpredictability, reserve capacity)
4. Conflicting priorities (one priority per capacity unit)
5. Neglected work (becomes emergency, revenue protection, kill zombie projects)

# Expose time theft to optimize workflow

1. Make work visible (value vs visibility; feature, architecture, bug, tech debt; only one person knows how to do it, work impacts other teams, work is composed of very small taks; too many interruptions, conflicting priorities)
2. Ambush the ringleader (Use kanban; lanes: silver bullet,team work, business requests, unplanned work, maintenance; columns: next, study, build/fix, feedback/cycling/done, deliver)
3. Expose dependencies (dependencies matrix)
4. Commiting the perfect crime - unplanned work (ratio of unplanned to total work, reserve capacity, office hours)
5. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize (CoD: missed revenue (protection, generation), extra costs (staff, operational maintenace), other CoD from dependencies)
6. Preventing negligence (attention, killm move to backlog; aging report)
7. Useful board designs (examples)

# Metrics, feedback and circunstances

1. Metrics or money (flow time, wip, capacity, queue, flow efficiency)
2. Measure time theft (partitioned by cause)
3. Operations review (timebox; throughput, flow time, issues and blocked work items; track over time)
4. Meetings (Agenda, timebox; blocked, at risk of becoming blocked? not on the board?)
5. Practices
