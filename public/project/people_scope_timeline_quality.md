	- Internal Open Source + CI CD / Consistent and Resilient Codebase
	- Work can be parallelized and worked on isolation / Communication overhead

# Scope

- Stability
- Innovation

# Timeline

- Specification
- Estimation
- Resources

# Quality

> The amount of bugs that have to be fixed after a release
> The amount of people that have to be added after a release (fix and maintain)
> The delta in scope that can be added per unit of time

- Compounds
- Acceleration (People, Scope, Time)
